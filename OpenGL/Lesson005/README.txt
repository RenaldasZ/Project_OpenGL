Learn how to create vertex array objects to manage the associations between vertex buffer data and attribute ("in") variables in a vertex shader. 
Then, create an application that uses a vertex array object and the Attribute class to draw a hexagon and illustrates different draw modes 
(points, lines, line loop, triangles, triangle fan). 
Create a second application that uses multiple vertex array objects to draw multiple shapes at once.
