Learn how to use shader variables with the type qualifiers "in" and "out" to pass data from the vertex shader to the fragment shader. 
Create an application that draws six vertices as points, each with a different color. 
Then experiment with different draw modes to see that the vertex data (colors) is interpolated for each pixel within the geometric shapes.
