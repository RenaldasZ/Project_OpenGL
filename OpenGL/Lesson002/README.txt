Learn the basics of GLSL: data types, the type qualifiers "in" and "out", the structure of shader programs, 
and the simplest possible shader code that can be used to render a single point in the center of the screen.

Learn about the OpenGL functions used to send shader code to the GPU, compile shader programs, 
link shaders to create a program, and perform error checking. Then create a utility class to perform these tasks.
