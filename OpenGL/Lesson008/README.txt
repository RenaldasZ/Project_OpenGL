Create shader programs containing uniform variables used to change the position and set the color of a geometric object. 
Then create an application that draws two triangles, in different positions and with different colors, 
using Uniform objects to upload values to the uniform variables in the shader program. 
Finally, expanding on this application, change the values of the uniform data over time to create animated effects: 
one triangle moves upward, while the other triangle shifts colors.
