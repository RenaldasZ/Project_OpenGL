Learn about the core concepts and vocabulary used in computer graphics, including rendering, raster, pixels, 
RGB values, resolution, precision, buffers (frame buffers, color buffers, depth buffers, stencil buffers), 
animation, frames, GPU (including a bit of history), shader languages, and OpenGL.

Learn about the four stages of the graphics pipeline:
* The Application Stage: initializing the window and sending data to the GPU.
* Geometry Processing: determining the vertex positions, involving a program called the vertex shader.
* Rasterization: determining which pixels correspond to the shapes being rendered.
* Pixel Processing: determining the color of each pixel, involving a program called a fragment shader.

Learn about setting up Python, installing the packages needed for creating the framework.

Start creating an extendable graphics framework in Python with a base class that creates a window with Pygame.
